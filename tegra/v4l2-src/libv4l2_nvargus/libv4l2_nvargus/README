LIBV4L2_NVARGUS API is a V4L2 API interface written over Libargus Camera to support
capture and record v4l2 camera application development.

API_NOTE:
    1. For V4L2 DMABUF Memory buffers, additional VIDIOC_QUERYBUF ioctl is also required
       to have proper mapping between application allocated buffers to Libargus buffers.

LIBV4L2_NVARGUS API includes:
    1. Source files of the written V4L2 interface, where respective v4l2_ioctl calls
       are mapped to LibArgus calls.
    2. README

Pre-requisites:
    1. Install "jetson_multimedia_api" package from latest Jetpack release.
    2. Install below packages:
        $ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool curl make g++ unzip \
        pkg-config libx11-dev libgtk-3-dev libjpeg-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev

Steps for copying sources on target:
    1. Copy the tar file libv4l2_nvargus_src.tbz2 to the booted Jetson device.
    2. Run the following command on the Jetson device to install sources:
        $ sudo tar -xpf libv4l2_nvargus_src.tbz2 -C .

Steps to build sources:
    $ cd libv4l2_nvargus_src
    $ make [-jN] # Optional flag -jN for parallel build where N is the job count
    $ sudo make install
    NOTE: above command will install libv4l2_nvargus.so at "/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/tegra/"
    To install at different location run "$ sudo INSTALL_DIR=<your_path> make install"
